        Japanese food is one of my favorite cuisines. I love trying to recreate all of the delicious flavors at home! You should definitely give this hibachi chicken, chicken katsu, and seared ahi tuna a try!

    <!--Steps to prepare the recipe-->
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Sauté Vegetables: Add the sesame oil into a large pot and heat over medium heat. Add in the garlic and ginger and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add in the sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-5 minutes or until softened.</li>
            <li>Add Liquids: Pour in the chicken stock, water, and soy sauce. </li>
            <li><b>Simmer:</b> Then bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook Bokchoy: Add the bokchoy and then simmer for an additional 2 minutes to soften the leaves.
            </li>
            <li>Add Noodles: Remove the pot from the heat. Then place the ramen noodles in the hot pot of broth. Allow the noodles to sit for ONLY a couple of minutes until they loosen and soften up. The noodles will soften quickly, so this should be done right before serving. 
            </li>
            <li>Transfer to Serving Bowls: Divide the ramen, veggies, and broth evenly into bowls.
            </li>
            <li>Add Toppings: Top the ramen with sliced grilled chicken and soft boiled eggs. Then garnish with toppings of choice and enjoy!
        </ol>
