    <p>Mochi is made with glutinous rice, which is turned into flour and eventually into a rice cake. It has a rich history in Japan and, while it’s enjoyed year-round, it’s especially eaten around Japanese New Year.

    <p>In this recipe, however, mochi is the sweet rice dough that encases your ice cream of choice. It has an incredible squishy texture and is just slightly sweet, helping to balance out the sweetness of your ice cream of choice.
